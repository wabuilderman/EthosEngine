Halo + Player-Choice

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yftGPkZxnKk :
"How do you handle someone walking up to the character which starts the main quest, and shooting them in the head?"
For a weapon-sandbox game, shooting people is a core mechanic. As such, it should always be an option to the player
to just shoot and kill any character they meet.



================================= World ============================================
Races:
Cat-people - Space pirates
Snake-people - stealth (assassins + snipers); theme - neon crystals in the dark
wolf-people - Fairly generic 'good-guys', the primary civilization in the region.


The wolf-people and snake-people are fighting a vicious war, that has been ongoing for almost a year. Both sides are exhausted.



BBEG is portrayed as someone who is idealisitic, they go out of their way to save lives and treat people humanely.
A situation quickly develops - BBEG must choose between saving a few, personable lives, or saving millions.
They wholehearted believes that 'things will work out in the end. You need to do what's right in the here and now.'
However, as the player is tasked with preventing the large catastrophe, they are put in direct conflict with the BBEG.
In the final battle, the catastrophe unfolds, and the BBEG realizes his niavity, collapsing in grief.

=============================== Gameplay ============================================
Scope Limitations:
This is not an open-world game. There should be a small number of levels, with a start and an end. All levels are
visited in order, regardless of player choice.

How is narrative delivered?
in-world, non-cutscene sequences. Dialogue should be kept mindfully short (though not so short as to be lacking in depth)
Dialogue primarily occurs in significant lulls in combat (i.e. just after getting to an outpost or something). Dialogue choices depend on optional criteria in previous combat.
(for instance, saving all civilians, or killing all enemies, or killing *no* enemies. Criteria unmarked, but should be vaguely indicated by dialogue.
For instance "All this senseless bloodshed" might indicate a 'no-kill' criteria for an extra dialouge option)


Specific elements:
	Enemy AI
	Companion AI
	Friendly AI
	Gunplay
	Dialogue Menu
